        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Phelps is arguably the greatest Olympian ever. Some might argue that Usain Bolt, Carl Lewis or Nadia Comaneci have a claim. But for sheer numbers of medals claimed, there is a clear, hands-down winner: Michael Phelps. Even given the fact that Phelps practices a sport in which extremely capable athlete can bag golds across different distances and strokes, his feats still blow away those of any other sportsperson.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhelps has 28 medals in total: his 23 gold medals are more than double the count of his nearest rivals, and its not as if other swimmers have accrued silly numbers of medals, either. Apart from Spitz, Matt Biondi (USA, eight golds) and Jenny Thompson (USA, eight golds), no other swimmer worldwide has managed more than six gold medals in total. 23 is astonishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhelps was born in Baltimore on June 30, 1985, and got serious with the sport after joining the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. He was raised by mother Deborah, alongside his sisters Hilary and Whitney, after his parents divorced.\r\n\r\n\r\nA prodigy at his sport, he went to Sydney 2000 aged just 15 \u2013the youngest man in the USA team for an Olympic Games in 68 years). He came close to the podium only in the 200m butterfly, where he finished fifth. From then on, he would dominate the next four Games, finishing the most decorated athlete at every one. In Athens he won six gold medals and two bronzes, falling just short of Mark Spitz\u2019s world record (seven golds at Munich 1972).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeijing 2008 would see the greatest ever medal haul by a single athlete in an Olympic Games. Phelps won eight golds \u2013 every event he entered \u2013 and broke World Records in seven of them. His record looks unlikely to be surpassed any time soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon 2012 was also astonishing \u2013 he got four golds and two silvers \u2013 while Rio 1016 saw him stage a historic comeback (he had decided to retire after London), aged 31, to bag five gold medals and one silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is now retired and is married to Nicole, with whom he has three sons, Boomer, Becker, and Maverick. Phelps works for his own charitable foundation, which has a particular emphasis on the mental health of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith 15 podium finishes at three Olympic Games, seven of them as champion, Nikolai Andrianov has won more Olympic medals than any other male gymnast in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nScherbo\u2019s mentor\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Barcelona 1992, Vitaly Scherbo won six gold medals, setting a new artistic gymnastics record for a single edition of the Games. He revealed that he owed his success to the man who had coached him as a junior, Nikolai Andrianov. Andrianov had protected and encouraged the talented by tempestuous youngster when he was excluded from the USSR team. \u201cHe was my mentor. He taught me how to concentrate, to keep myself inside myself\u201d, revealed Scherbo. Andrianov\u2019s faith in his charge paid off. In Barcelona, Scherbo beat the record of four gold medals that he himself had set at Montreal 1976. However, the young pretender remained some way off his mentor\u2019s cumulative tally of 15 Olympic medals, a haul that has only been bettered by one other male athlete, American swimmer Michael Phelps, who took his overall tally to 22 at London 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\nA natural talent\r\n\r\n\r\nRaised by his mother in Vladimir, 190km to the east of Moscow, Nikolai Yefimovich Andrianov first tried his hand at gymnastics when he was 12, and was fortunate enough to be spotted by a renowned coach from the Soviet school, Nikolai Tolkachev. Under Tolkachev\u2019s tutelage, Andrianov built on his exceptional physical qualities (he boasted incredible upper body strength combined with phenomenal suppleness) and his progress was rapid. At the age of 18, he was selected for the USSR national team, and at the 1971 European Championships he won six medals, including golds in the pommel horse and vault.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedal detector\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrianov\u2019s seven Olympic gold medals included two on floor (1972 and 1976), two on vault (1976 and 1980), one individual all-around (1976), one on still rings (1976) and one in the team all-around (1980). He also won five silvers and three bronze medals. It was at his second Games, in Montreal, that Andrianov was at the height of his powers, and was\u00a0 near ever-present on the podium, with seven medal finishes out of a possible eight. His finest moment came in the rings, where he was the only competitor to complete a triple reverse salto in the dismount. At Moscow 1980, where he took his overall tally to 15 Olympic medals, setting a record that would stand until Michael Phelps first took the Olympic oath in 2008, Andrianov was chosen to read the Olympic oath during the Opening Ceremony. In addition his Olympic haul, he also won 12 medals in the World Championships (four of them gold), and claimed the European title no less than 10 times.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to where it all began\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he stopped competing in 1980, Andrianov spent the following 12 years coaching the USSR national junior team, where he guided Scherbo to the summit. He then served for a period as an international judge, before accepting an invitation from his old rival and friend Mitsuo Tsukahara to coach the Japanese men\u2019s team in 1994. After guiding Japan to the all-around team gold at Athens 2004, he returned to his hometown of Vladimir, taking the reigns as head of the gymnastics school where he had started out as a youngster. It was there, on 21 March 2011, following a long battle with illness, Nikolai Andrianov died at the age of just 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That all changed when he first entered a gymnastics hall, where he harnessed his ability to learn quickly and work hard to make rapid progress on the horizontal bar. He continued that progress at Kyoiku University in Tokyo, where he was a brilliant student and excelled on each of the various apparatus, working under the famous coach Akitomo Kaneko. At 18, Kato made his debut in the national team where his remarkable levels of dedication, precision of movement and self-discipline were soon paying dividends. \r\n\r\n\r\nKato versus the USSR\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways ready to apply his own innovative ideas in training, most famously deploying the trampoline to practice his routines, Kato made his Olympic bow in Mexico City in 1968. Despite the fact he was nursing an Achilles tendon injury, it turned out to be a golden debut. As was the case throughout his career, he faced intense competition from the Soviet gymnasts, no more so than his duel with Mikhail Voronin in the individual all-around competition, which brought him his first gold. The Japan-Soviet rivalry resumed in the team competition, which yielded another gold for Kato and his team-mates. And he then claimed a second individual gold in the floor exercise, before taking the bronze in the rings.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new gold standard\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1972 in Munich, Japan once again got the better of the USSR in the team competition, while Kato retained his title in the individual all-around, added another gold in the parallel bars, and then took silver on the vault and bronze on the horizontal bar. Four years later in Montreal, he missed out on a third successive individual all-round gold by a single point, losing out to his Soviet rival Nikolai Andrianov. However, the Japanese men\u2019s team once again prevailed over the USSR in the team competition, this time by a mere four tenths of a point. Kato then completed the successful defence of his parallel bars title, taking his overall tally of Olympic golds to eight, more than any other male gymnast in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to school\r\n\r\n\r\nKato called time on his competitive career at the age of 29, and went on to become a professor at the same university where he had completed his studies (which had been renamed Tsukuba University). Until 1998, he served as the Vice President of the Technical Commission of the International Gymnastics Federation. Kato was inducted into the Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Four more world titles followed in 1970 (team, rings, floor and parallel bars), and two Olympic ones in Munich, where he successfully defended his team and rings titles. Of note, Nakayama never won the individual all-around in any of these competition, although he also excelled in the combined event, winning it at the 1969 World Cup and 1965 and 1967 Universiade.

The best tournament for Voronin was the 1968 Olympics, where he medaled in every event, except floor exercise, winning two gold medals (horizontal bar and vault), four silvers (individual all-around, parallel bars, rings and team event) and a pommelled horse bronze. At the 1972 Olympics, Voronin won two more silvers (rings, team event), bringing his total count of Olympic medals to nine. At the World Championships, Voronin won eight medals, including two World titles, both in 1966, in individual all-around and rings. He also won four silvers (1966\/1970 team, 1966 pommelled horse and parallel bars) and two bronzes (1970 parallel bars and 1970 rings). Voronin also won eight European titles (1967\/1969 individual all-around and parallel bars, 1967\/1969\/1971 rings and 1967 pommelled horse) and 15 medals in total at the European Championships. Domestically, Voronin was a 16-time Soviet champion (1967-68\/70-71 individual all-around, 1966-67\/69-72 rings, 1967\/69 parallel bars, 1967\/70 in pommelled horse, 1966 floor exercise, 1971 horizontal bar). Voronin finished his sporting career after the 1972 Olympics and from 1973-94 was the head coach of Dynamo Moskva gymnastics team. From 1978-88, Voronin also worked as the president of Russian SFSR Gymnastics federation. From 1994 until his death in 2004, Voronin was the president of the Dynamo Moskva gymnastics club. His first wife Zinaida Voronina was also a gymnast and 1968 Olympic champion and their son Dmitry also became an international level gymnast. Zinaida and Mikhail Voronin divorced in 1980.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Having qualified for the 800m freestyle final third overall, she surprised the field by taking gold in the final by more than four seconds \u2013 and breaking an American record that had stood since 1989.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing into the Rio Games, then, a lot was expected \u2013 and Ledecky didn\u2019t disappoint.

She finished sixth with the Jamaican relay team in the final. But it was in the 200m that she shone to take the bronze medal, an Olympic first by a female athlete in her country. Four years later at the Los Angeles Games, she once again excelled, taking two bronze medals, in the 100 and 200m. She again led the 4x100m relay team in the final, which this time finished in eighth place.\r\n\r\n\r\nElected athlete of the year 15 times in Jamaica\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough injured, she ended her third Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988 with a fourth-place finish in the 200m, and two eliminations in the 100m semi-final and relay final. The woman who was elected \"Athlete of the Year\" 15 times in Jamaica won a new bronze medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, still in the 200m. Over 100m, she finished fifth, and in the 4x100m relay, Jamaica failed once again in the final by not finishing the race.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree medals at 36 years of age\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 36, she found recognition at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996. There she won three medals. In the 100m, she finished at the same time as the USA\u2019s Gail Devers, separated only by the photo finish, the gold being awarded to Devers. In the 200m, Merlene finished 12 hundredths of a second behind France\u2019s Marie-Jos\u00e9 Perec. In the 4x100m relay, Jamaica was rewarded with the bronze medal in a thrilling neck-and-neck race, with the USA finally victorious and the Bahamas second.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore medals and a new country to run for\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sydney 2000 Olympic Games allowed Merlene Ottey to win a silver medal with the relay behind the Bahamas.

Competing for Slovenia, her coach\u2019s country and her new adopted country since 2002, Merlene Ottey competed in her last Olympic Games in Athens in 2004. At the age of 44, she managed to qualify for the semi-finals in the sprint events.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of two at seven editions of the Games\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly an Olympic title is lacking from her incredible career tally of eight medals at the Games (a record) and 14 World Championship medals, including two world titles over 200m, in 1993 and 1995, and another obtained with the Jamaican relay team in 1991.

Sent on milk rounds by his parents with a dog and a cart, he would often send the dog home after completing his deliveries and steal away to hone his craft. The talented young archer caused a sensation at the age of 16, getting the better of an experienced Belgian and Dutch field to win his first major tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympic debut\r\n\r\n\r\nArchery first appeared on the Olympic programme at Paris 1900, forming part of the \u201cConcours internationaux d'exercices physiques et de sports\u201d held between May and October that year, all under the umbrella of the city\u2019s Exposition Universelle (World Fair). Held in the Bois de Vincennes during the summer, the Olympic archery competition featured six events: tir au cordon dor\u00e9 (33 metres and 50 metres); tir au chapelet (33 metres and 50 metres), tir sur la Perche \u00e0 Herse and tir sur la Perche \u00e0 la Pyramide.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight on target\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Innis was by now an experienced archer in his mid-30s, and in Paris he competed in four events. He began by taking silver in the 50-metre cordon dor\u00e9 behind France\u2019s Henri H\u00e9rouin, and followed up by winning the 33-metre cordon dor\u00e9 and the tir au chapelet at the same distance. He recorded his worst result in the 50-metre tir au chapelet, finishing only fourth. The double Olympic champion did not defend his titles at St Louis 1904 and also missed London 1908, with archery then being omitted from the programme at Stockholm 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few medals more\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Belgian was back on the medal hunt on home soil at Antwerp 1920, by which time he had turned 54. Victorious in the individual 28-metre and 33-metre moving bird target events, he won silver in the 50-metre competition and added two more golds to his collection in the 33-metre and 50-metre moving bird target team events. In also picking up a silver for good measure in the 28-metre team competition, he took his Olympic medal haul to six golds and three silvers, making him the most successful archer in the history of the Games and Belgium\u2019s leading Olympian. He also remains to this day among the Games\u2019 top 20 medallists of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lifetime\u2019s devotion\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the sport\u2019s absence from the Olympic programme for the next 52 years, only reappearing at Munich 1972, Van Innis continued to enjoy great success on the international stage, winning the world title in 1933 as a mere 67-year-old. Such was his passion for archery that he even set up a practice range at the restaurant he owned in the Belgian capital, and he continued to play the sport through to his death on 25 November 1961, at the age of 95. His legend lives on. His great, great-granddaughter Sarah Prieels, who was born in 1990, is also an international archer, while a statue of Van Innis\u2019 now stands in his home town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Romanian gymnast scored a \u201cperfect 10\u201d on the uneven bars in the team part of the gymnastics at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, and even the scoreboard didn\u2019t know what to do: it wasn\u2019t able to display the four digits needed to show a row of 10.00s, because nobody had even conceived that it was possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce it was proved achievable, though, she couldn\u2019t stop doing it: Comaneci got six more perfect tens as she swept to three gold medals (all around, uneven bars and balance beam) and international superstardom.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe didn\u2019t let the fact that the only way is down from there to affect her, either. Blessed with exceptional skill, balance and a clean technique, she added two more gold medals to her Montreal one at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow (balance beam and floor), and won two World Championship golds (1978 in the balance beam and 1979 in the Team) and numerous European titles.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was as innovative as she was technical, once in action. On the beam, she was the first gymnast to perform an aerial walkover and an aerial cartwheel-back handspring flight series. She also debuted the double twist dismount \u2013 and the double back salto on the floor. Her willingness to put creativity and ambition alongside technical excellence continues to influence the likes of Simone Biles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut things got tough after Moscow. While she did attend the Los Angeles 1984 games as a judge, she was severely restricted from leaving Romania, and found life tough after she retired from her sport. In 1989 she defected to the USA, working as a coach, businesswoman and model \u2013 and even appearing on The Apprentice. \u201cI don\u2019t run away from a challenge because I am afraid,\u201d she has said about her extraordinary life. \u201cInstead, I run toward it because the only way to escape fear is to trample it beneath your feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is still deeply involved in sports: Comaneci serves as the honorary president of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, the honorary president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, and is a member of the International Gymnastics Federation Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To do it three times at consecutive Games, and add the 200m and 4x100m relay titles to the mix, gives him a good case to be considered the greatest athlete of all time. Still only 33, he is a living legend. Add real charm and humour to the mix, and Bolt has been the superstar that the Games needed over the last decade and a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBolt was born on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, Jamaica. He grew up as a sports-obsessed kid, excelling in football and cricket. At high school, his cricket coach encouraged him to try athletics seriously. It was a good decision, By the age of 16, in 2002, he was world junior champion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 2007, he was the fastest man in history, setting his first 100m world record, and a year later, at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, he rose to international superstardom. In China, Bolt triumphed in the men\u2019s 100m sprint, and then added the 200m and 4x100m title to secure a legendary triple. He broke the world record in all three events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther magic was to follow. At London 2012 he bagged the 100m again (beating his own Olympic record), added the 200m title, and then teamed up with the other Jamaican sprinters to take the 4x100m. A \u2018double triple\u2019 had been secured. That became the \u2018triple triple\u2019 at Rio 2016. Despite entering the Games not quite looking his best, Bolt once again secured all three titles \u2013 100m, 200m and 4x100m \u2013 to make history once more.\r\n\r\n\r\nBolt had to return his 4x100m medal for Beijing 2008 after his teammate Nestor Carter was retroactively banned for a doping violation, but his personal record remains impeccable \u2013 and his sprinting record haul surely unbeatable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince his retirement in 2018, Bolt has remained extremely popular and high profile. He attempted to become a professional footballer \u2013 training with sides like Borussia Dortmund and Central Coast Mariners, as well as playing at Soccer Aid \u2013 and has got several business interests, including a new range of electric scooters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways a hit at personal appearances \u2013 he cropped up at the 2019 Super Bowl, where he equalled the fastest ever 40-yard dash \u2013 it seems like there will be a lot more to come from Bolt. The main challenge for the Olympic Games over the next decade? Finding another superstar of his stature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Ironically, Joyner's downfall in the heptathlon came in her best event, the long jump, when she fouled her first two attempts and had to play it safe with a mediocre final jump. In the end, she earned a silver medal, missing the gold by only five points. Had she jumped only three centimetres farther or finished the 800m only one third of a second faster, she would have won. In the formal long jump competition, she placed fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fantasy opponent\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time of the 1988 Olympic Games, Joyner-Kersee (she had married her coach, Bob Kersee) was so much better at the heptathlon than everyone else that her husband had to invent a fantasy opponent: Wilhelmina World Record. At the Olympic Games in Seoul, Joyner-Kersee won the gold by beating Wilhelmina by 76 points. Five days later, she earned a second gold medal in the long jump with a fifth-round leap of 7.40m.\r\n\r\n\r\nA jump right to the podium\r\n\r\n\r\nJoyner-Kersee easily won the heptathlon again at the 1992 Games in Barcelona.

Both marks bettered existing world records, but they were never ratified because they were made in an unsanctioned meet, and there was some question about their measurement. The shot put mark would not be bettered, however, until 1934. Apart from his four AAU shot titles, Rose won the discus twice and was the inaugural AAU javelin champion in 1909. Rose attended the University of Michigan and later studied law at Chicago. He was the flag-bearer in 1908 who refused to dip the flag as he walked past the English king, leading to the tradition which survives to this day. He died of typhoid fever in 1913, aged only 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Bests: SP \u2013 51-0\u00be (15.56) (1909); DT \u2013 40.81 (1910); HT \u2013 52.61 (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

During that time he won nine Olympic medals, 10 World Championships medals and 14 European Championships medals. His first international tournament was the 1956 Olympics, where he won four medals, including his only Olympic gold, won in the team event. At the 1960 Olympics he added three more medals and at the 1964 Olympics two more. During his career, Titov competed at two World Championships, winning two titles at each, the vault and team event title at the 1958 World Championships and the individual all-around and rings title at the 1962 World Championships. To his four World Championships golds, he added four bronzes at the 1958 Worlds and one silver at the 1962 Worlds. At the European Championships, Titov won eight titles, one in 1957 (vault), five in 1959 (individual all-around, vault, parallel bars, rings, pommelled horse) and two in 1961 (rings, horizontal bar). He also won four silvers and two bronzes at Europeans. Titov won seven Soviet titles (1958, 1961 in individual all-around, 1959 in floor exercise, in 1961 in rings and in horizontal bar and in 1958 and 1960 in vault). After finishing his sporting career, he worked as a gymnastics official and referee. From 1976-96, Titov was the president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). In 1991 he received the Olympic Order in Silver and from 1995-96 was a member of IOC in his role as president of FIG.

For her first Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, she was one of the young hopefuls to follow. But these Games ended for her with two eighth-place finishes in the 50m freestyle and the 4x100m medley. In the 100m butterfly, she did not qualify for the final. Feeling demotivated, Inge, who had swum since the age of seven, put her career on hold, even though she continued to train. Then followed a long difficult period, topped off by not qualifying for the Atlanta Games in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven world records in two weeks, and four Olympic medals\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spring 2000, she signalled her return to the top by beating or equalling seven world records in two weeks! The Dutch swimmer arrived in Sydney for the Olympic Games as firm favourite in the sprint events, a status she confirmed in the pool by taking three tiles in the 50m freestyle, the 100m freestyle and 100m butterfly. To these achievements she added exceptional times, lowering the Olympic and world records. Accompanied by compatriots Thamar Henneken, Wilma Van Rijn and Manon Van Rooijen, she helped the Dutch relay team take silver in the 4x100m freestyle behind the untouchable US team. At the World Championships in 2001 and 2003, Inge de Bruijn confirmed her status as Queen of the Sprint by taking several titles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the field from behind\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Athens Olympic Games in 2004, she once again competed in five events. For her first race, the 4x100m freestyle, Inge de Bruijn swam the last leg. Even though she could not catch the Americans and Australians, she overtook Germany\u2019s Franziska Van Almsick to snatch the bronze medal with teammates Chantal Groot, Inge Dekker, Marleen Veldhuis and Annabel Kosten (who swam in the semi-final). In the 100m butterfly, she took another Olympic bronze medal, behind another Australian, Petria Thomas, and Poland\u2019s Otylia J\u00eadrzejczak, even though she was only sixth at the half-way point.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing collecting medals\r\n\r\n\r\nHer third event was the 100m freestyle, where she came second behind Australia\u2019s Jodie Henry. On the last day of the swimming competitions, Inge competed in the 50m freestyle. The world- and Olympic-record holder took the lead by three tenths of a second, and thus held on to the title she had won in Sydney, taking her fourth Olympic gold medal. In her last event, the 4x100m relay medley, she finished in sixth place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Unusually for a kayak event, the final was a race \u201cagainst the clock\u201d, with each competitor making a staggered start in intervals of 30\u00a0seconds. Sweden\u2019s Gert Fredriksson rose to the challenge superbly to record a time of 50.47:7 and leave second-placed Kurt Wires of Finland, trailing in his wake by a margin of 30.5 seconds. To this day, it remains the biggest winning margin in the history of the event. The final of the K-1\u00a01,000m the following day reverted to a conventional group start but the outcome was the same, as the Swede was once more in unbeatable form. Holding back in fourth place for much of the race, he then accelerated into finish, crossing the line more than six seconds ahead of Norway\u2019s Johan Frederik Kobberup. Fredriksson\u2019s exploits at London 1948 were to be just the start of the Olympic journey for the 29-year old Nyk\u00f6ping-born paddler, whose impressive technique allied to enormous physical and mental strength, would provide him with the formula for success for over a decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympic treble over 1,000m\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Helsinki\u00a01952, Fredriksson defended his K-1\u00a01,000m title with another fine display of power kayaking, but had to settle for silver in the K-1\u00a010,000m, finishing behind Finland\u2019s Thorvald Str\u00f6mberg. Four years later, on Lake Wendouree outside Melbourne, he reprised his achievements of London\u00a01948, as he notched a third consecutive Olympic title in the K-1\u00a01,000m and exacted his revenge on Str\u00f6mberg over the longer distance, to secure a second golden double.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast triumph in Rome\r\n\r\n\r\nFredriksson was back on the start line on Lake Albano, the hub for the rowing, canoe and kayak events at Rome\u00a01960. Despite the fact that he was now 41, he took bronze in the K-1\u00a01,000m and then secured another gold together with Sven-Olov Sj\u00f6delius in the K-2\u00a01,000m. With eight medals, including six gold, he remains the most successful male kayaker in Olympic history.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmortalised on home soil\r\n\r\n\r\nFredriksson finally retired from competition in 1964, having amassed seven world titles to go with his Olympic medal haul. However, he soon returned to the Olympic stage as trainer of the Swedish kayak team at the\u00a01968 games in Mexico City. Nyk\u00f6ping honoured Fredriksson with a statue, ensuring that the incredible feats of its favourite son, who passed away in his home town on 5\u00a0July\u00a02006, are immortalised in bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

His 1904 50 yds freestyle victory came in a second race after the judges declared a dead heat in the first race between Halmay and J. Scott Leary of the United States. What is more remarkable, is that although Halmay swam mostly with his arms, without any leg movements, he still beat the strong Americans, who used their legs while swimming and thus had a more efficient style.  In both his 1904 gold medals, he beat young Charlie Daniels, who went on to be the most dominant swimmer of the decade and who invented the \u201cAmerican crawl\u201d that is the basis of modern freestyle swimming.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Halmay set what is considered the inaugural record for the 100 m freestyle, recording 1:05.8, which stood until the 1908 Olympics, where Daniels surpassed it by 0.2 seconds, a remarkable length of time during a period of rapid development in the sport. Halmay set his second world record in 1908, just three weeks before the 1908 Olympics, when he swam the 200 m freestyle in 2:26.8, bettering Fred Lane\u2019s 6-year old record by nearly 2 seconds. Halmay won 15 Hungarian titles \u2013 100 yds freestyle in 1899, 1901-04, 1906, and 1907; 110 yds freestyle in 1908; 220 yds freestyle in 1906-08; 440 yds freestyle in 1905 and 1907; and 1 mile freestyle in 1897 and 1899. He also won English, German and Austrian championships.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalmay took up competitive swimming in 1896 and competed until 1910. Besides swimming he played football and water polo and did track & field athletics and rowing. He was also Hungarian national roller-skating champion over 5000 m. From 1910-19 Halmay worked as a journalist with the Hungarian sports paper Vad\u00e1sz \u00e9s Versenylap and from 1919-28 was manager of the Hungarian national swimming team. He then worked with the Hungarian Royal Tobacco Monopoly, first as an office worker and then as a director. From 1937 until his 1945 retirement, Halmay worked as a director of a Budapest rubber-textile factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Bests: 100 m freestyle \u2013 1:06.2 (1908); 200 m freestyle \u2013 2:26.8 (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, he was also a quick learner and a natural talent. Eight years later he was on his way to his first Olympic Games, in Mexico City, as a member of the Japan team that won its third consecutive team gold. The individual events at Mexico 1968 were dominated by Tsukahara\u2019s team-mate Sawao Kato, who won three golds. Meanwhile, Tsukahara finished 18th in the individual all-around event, while he just missed out on a podium place in the floor, taking fourth place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Tsukahara\u2019 is born\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Ljubljana (SLV), Tsukahara secured the vault title with a dismount of his own invention: a backward salto with a half twist on entry, followed by a reverse 1.5 twist. The \u201cTsukahara vault\u201d, though highly technical, remains widely used today, and even has its own entry in the dictionary. There was more innovation to come at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, where Tsukahara and his compatriots dominated the team event for a fourth successive Games. He then put in a scintillating performance in the individual horizontal bar, where his perfectly executed dismount with a full-twisting double salto in the tuck position had the crowd bursting into applause, earning Tsukahara a maximum score of 9.9, another gold... and another skill that would forever more carry his name. Similar tumbles or dismounts across all of the different apparatus are now commonly known as \u201ca Tsukahara\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh five in Montreal\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Montreal in 1976, Tsukahara raised the bar further still. In the team competition Japan faced fierce competition from the USSR, and going into the very final routine everything was still in the balance. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Tsukahara\u2019s unique interpretation on the horizontal bar scored 9.9, which was enough to seal a fifth consecutive Olympic team success for Japan. In the individual competitions, Tsukahara went on to retain his title in the high bar, took silver in the vault, bronze on the parallel bars and in the individual all-around event. His overall tally in three editions of the Games stood at five golds, one silver and three bronze medals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike father, like son\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Tsukahara\u2019s son Naoya was born. His mother was Chieko Oda, was also an Olympic gymnast, and so it was not surprising that Naoya eventually followed in his parents\u2019 footsteps. Indeed, he went on to win six medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, and like his father was a member of the Japanese team at three Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004, winning an all-around team gold at the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nA gold medallist at each of the six Olympic Games she has graced, Germany\u2019s Isabell Werth is one of the most successful riders in the history of dressage and equestrian. In winning team gold and individual silver at Tokyo 2020, she took her collection of Olympic medals to a record 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal eagle\r\n\r\n\r\nHailing from Sevelen in Germany, Isabell Werth enjoyed a brilliant academic career and took up a position with a law firm in 2001. From her early years, however, her real passion was horse riding, and dressage in particular. At the age of 17, she was taken under the wing of the well-known owner and trainer Dr Uwe Schulten-Baumer, which proved the the start of the most successful collaboration in the history of dressage. The relationship came into its own when Werth was paired up with a chestnut gelding by the name of Gigolo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perfect match\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking dressage to new levels with a dazzling combination of precision, artistry, talent and stamina, Werth and Gigolo collected four Olympic golds between 1992 and 2000. Victorious in the team event at Barcelona 1992, the duo won the individual and team competitions at Atlanta 1996 and the team gold at Sydney 2000, with individual silvers in Barcelona and Atlanta. In the meantime, the duo also won four world titles (in the individual and team events in 1994 and 1998), and five European crowns, achievements that made them the most successful pairing in the entire history of the sport.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaying on top\r\n\r\n\r\nWerth decided to turn professional and devote herself entirely to her sport. Ending her long association with Dr Schulten-Baumer, she opened her own stables in Rheinberg, near her home village, and was soon enjoying more international success with a new generation of horses. A double world champion in 2006, Werth returned to the Olympic arena at Beijing 2008 to win another team gold and an individual silver, this time on Satchmo. By that stage of her glittering career, she had won eight Olympic medals (five of them gold), six world titles and seven European crowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetitive streak\r\n\r\n\r\nWerth was forced to miss London 2012 on account of her mount Don Johnson suffering an injury and her other horse, El Santo, not being ready to compete. Bitterly disappointed to be missing out on the Games, she watched as team-mates Helen Langehanenberg, Dorothee Schneider and Kristina Spree won team silver behind Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite developing and launching her own successful range of equestrian accessories in the meantime, Werth said she had no desire to stop competing. \u201cMy goal is to carry on for as long as possible, for at least another 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m sure that horses will always play a big part in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA record in Rio\r\n\r\n\r\nThat determination to keep on riding competitively saw her step out at Rio 2016 at the age of 47, this time on a fine 11-year-old black mare by the name of Weihegold Old. Joining forces with Kristina Br\u00f6ring-Sprehe, Dorothee Schneider and Sonke Rothenberger, Werth helped Germany to an average score of 81.936% in the team competition. It was a performance that earned her a fifth Olympic team gold, a sixth gold of her career and a ninth medal in all. \u201cI love horses and I love training,\u201d said Werth afterwards. \u201cWinning gold with three different horses means more than anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later, Great Britain\u2019s Charlotte Dujardin, a silver medallist in the team competition, retained her individual title in style, thanks to a stunning Grand Prix Freestyle score of 93.857%. Werth took the runners-up spot with a score of 89.071%, giving her a tenth Olympic medal in 24 years, more than any other rider in the history of equestrian since the sport was introduced on the programme at the second Games of the modern era, in 1900. Asked if she was considering adding to her haul at Tokyo 2020, the German veteran said: \u201cWho knows? We\u2019re going to work towards that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeat in Tokyo\r\n\r\n\r\nShe did just that in the Japanese capital in 2021, at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, with a repeat of the medals she had won in 1992, 2000, 2008, and 2016 \u2013 team gold and individual silver, riding Bella Rose 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time, it was her teammate Jessica von Bredow-Werndl who pipped her to the individual crown, outscoring her 91.732 to 89.657.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Unfortunately for him, his career coincided with that of swimming megastar Michael Phelps, also an expert in the medleys. This has deprived Cseh of all but one international level title. At the Beijing Olympics, he won three silvers (all behind Phelps), and he has similarly won six World Championships medals (three silver, three bronze) in medley events behind Phelps. The only exception came when Phelps skipped the 400 IM at the 2005 worlds, allowing Cseh to claim the world title. Outside of the medley events, he has also done well in the butterfly (one silver at the Beijing Games) and the backstroke (bronze at the 2005 Worlds). In European championships, with Phelps not competing, Cseh has been dominant. He has won four consecutive 400 IM titles (2004-2010), three consecutive 200 individual medley golds (2006-2010) and a gold in the 100 back (100 m). In the European Short Course Championships, he has collected 19 medals, of which 13 were gold. Six of these were won in the 400 IM. With Phelps rarely competing in short-course events, Cseh has been able to set short-course world records in the medley events on three occasions, all of which were broken by another US swimmer, Ryan Lochte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00c1gnes Keleti is the greatest gymnast produced by Hungary, but one whose life and career were intertwined with the politics of her country and her religion. She first became interested in gymnastics shortly before World War II and her training began at the well-known Jewish VAC Club of Budapest. She quickly became a top young gymnast, but her career was interrupted by World War II. During the war, her father was removed to Auschwitz, where he was killed by the Nazis. \u00c1gnes Keleti and the rest of her family survived by finding refuge in a \u201cSwedish House\u201d administered by Raoul Wallenberg, who became quite famous for assisting Jews to escape from concentration camps.After World War II, Keleti returned to gymnastics and won her first Hungarian championship in 1946, on the uneven parallel bars. In 1947, she made her first international impact when she dominated the Central European Gymnastics Championships. After the War, she initially earned her living as a fur worker, but she was later a demonstrator at the Faculty of Gymnastics of the Budapest School for Physical Culture. Keleti was also an accomplished musician, playing the cello, and she played professionally.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter serving as an alternate in 1948, Keleti competed in the 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games, at which she won 10 medals, including five gold. At the 1954 World Gymnastics Championships she won the uneven parallel bars, for her only individual world title, and also was on the winning Hungarian team in the team portable apparatus event. Keleti won four medals at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, including an individual gold in the floor exercises. But her greatest gymnastics effort came at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics when she won six medals, including four gold. In the individual apparatus finals, she won the balance beam, floor exercises, and the uneven parallel bars. A poor performance in the horse vault, where she finished 23rd, cost her the all-around individual gold, at which she finished second to the Soviet Union\u2019s Larisa Latynina. Keleti also won gold as part of the Hungarian team in the portable apparatus event.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut despite her success in Melbourne, politics had again interceded in her career. In late October, Israel invaded Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, and then shortly before the 1956 Olympics, on 4 November 1956, Soviet tanks entered Budapest to quell an uprising there. The two events led to a small boycott of the Olympics. Although Hungary competed, many of its athletes defected, and Keleti was among them. She stayed in Australia and then settled in Israel, where she taught physical education at the Orde Wingate Institute and later became the national women\u2019s gymnastics coach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nEthiopia\u2019s Tirunesh Dibada is the youngest female world champion in the history of athletics, the first woman to achieve the Olympic 5,000m\/10,000m double, and the first to successfully defend a long-distance title at the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn to run\r\n\r\n\r\nTirunesh Dibaba was born the city of Bekoji, nestled in the high plains of Ethiopia at an altitude of 2,800m, and home to a number of long-distance champions, including Derartu Tulu and Kenenisa Bekele, who between them won five Olympic titles. She attributes her skill as a runner and her stamina to necessity: \u201cI grew up running with pails of water that I went to fetch from the river after school every day, to help my mother,\u201d she once explained.She is one of three siblings who have enjoyed success on the track. Her older sister Ejegayehu was a 10,000m Olympic silver medalist in Athens in 2004, while younger sister Genzebe is the 2015 world champion and current world record holder over 1,500m.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeenage track tyro\r\n\r\n\r\nDibaba was just 18 when she took part in her first major international competition, the 2003 World Athletics Championships in Paris. Going into the last straight in the 5,000m final, she shrugged off her opponents to cross the line in 14.51.72 and become the youngest female athletics world champion in history, and the latest in a long line of Ethiopian long-distance greats. \u201cWhen you compete for Ethiopia you must bring back gold,\u201d she later explained. \u201cPeople in our country don\u2019t accept anything less. Winning silver or bronze is the same as coming fifth or sixth.\u201dLooking back on that maiden victory, she said: \u201cI was only 18 and I remember how desperately I wanted to be a champion. Winning was so amazing! I\u2019ll always remember it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympic debut\r\n\r\n\r\nDibaba\u2019s early success while still in her teens earned her the nickname \u2018Baby-Faced Destroyer\u2019. Despite having her preparations for Athens 2004 disrupted by a knee injury, she still managed to win bronze in the 5,000m, finishing behind her compatriot Mereset Defar and Kenya\u2019s Isabella Ochichi. The following year, at the Worlds in Helsinki, she completed a 5,000m\/10,000m double, and then in 2007, in Osaka (JPN) claimed her fourth world title, with a now trademark acceleration into the finish of the 10,000m final. To go with these successes on the track, Dibaba was also crowned world cross-country champion five times between 2003 and 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nA historic double in Beijing\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 6 June 2008 in Oslo, Dibaba set a new 5,000m world record of 14.11:15, which has yet to be bettered. Later that year, at the Olympic Games in Beijing, she achieved another historic first for women\u2019s athletics, winning both the 10,000m (in a new Olympic record time of 29.54:66) and then the 5,000m, seeing off the challenge of Turkey\u2019s Ethiopian-born runner Elvan Abeylegesse on both occasions. In each race her modus operandi was the same: accelerating into an unstoppable breakaway in the final lap to leave her rivals eating dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to the future\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite four years battling with injury, Dibaba was back in the fray for the 10,000m final at London 2012, and remarkably managed to retain her title (yet another first). Going into the final 800m she showed that she had lost none of her ability to change gear, surging into an unbeatable lead over the last two laps. She followed up by winning bronze in the 5,000m, where she was beaten by her compatriot and longstanding rival Meseret Defar.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nFifth world title and maternity leave\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the 2013 World Championships in Moscow (RUS) Dibaba won her third 10,000m world title, taking her total number of world championship crowns to five ten years. A year later she made her marathon debut at the London Marathon in 2014, where she placed third with a time of 2:20:34.\u00a0Married to double Olympic 10,000m silver medalist Sileshi Sihine, Dibaba then took a break from competition to start a family and in March 2015 gave birth to her son Nathan. However, motherhood didn\u2019t slow her down for long, and in May 2016, little more than a year after giving birth, she returned to the track. Shortly after she suffered her first ever defeat over 10,000m, finishing third in the Ethiopian Olympic selection trials in Hengelo (NED), losing out to the upcoming youngster Almaz Ayana.\r\n\r\n\r\nA third Olympic 10,000m medal in Rio\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking ahead to Rio 2016, where she was aiming for an unprecedented third title in the 10,000m, she mused: \u201cI run to make people happy,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything expected of me as an athlete. I\u2019ve won many competitions, but I\u2019ve yet to run the marathon. The Olympic marathon is what I have left to achieve. I\u2019ll compete in it soon. I want to achieve something that is historic and unforgettable.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Dibaba but Ayana who stole the spotlight on the first day of track and field competition in Rio on 12 August. The youngster stormed to an incredible victory over 10,000m, smashing Wang Junxia\u2019s 1993 world record by 14 seconds with a time of 29:17.45.\u00a0Dibaba finished in third behind Kenyan Viviane Cheruyot, despite running her fastest ever time over the distance (23:32.52) and finishing under the previous world record. Despite failing to defend her Olympic title she nevertheless achieved an unrivalled feat, winning a third successive Olympic medal in the distance and a sixth Olympic medal in total (three gold and three bronze).\u201cI\u2019ve done something that no one else has done before me and I\u2019m very proud,\u201d she said of her achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday 14 August 2016 is a day that British gymnast Max Whitlock will always remember. Not content with winning gold in the floor to become his country\u2019s first ever Olympic gold medallist in artistic gymnastics, he went and won the pommel horse title, taking his overall Olympic medal tally to five. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhitlock had already proved his class at London 2012, where he won bronze in the team all-around (which was Great Britain\u2019s first team medal in artistic gymnastics since 1912), and another bronze in the pommel. Serving further notice of his abilities, he claimed pommel gold at the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow, before scoring that golden double at Rio 2016. He also took bronze in the individual all-around in Rio, behind the great Kohei Uchimura to claim Great Britain\u2019s first medal in the event for 108 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nA first for his country \r\n\r\n\r\nWhitlock\u2019s exploits in the Rio 2016 apparatus finals attracted a TV audience of more than 10.4 million viewers back home, with several famous faces from Team GB also gathering in the stands at the Rio Olympic Arena, among them Andy Murray. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe British gymnast did not let them down. Tipped to do well on the pommel horse \u2013 his favourite apparatus \u2013 he stunned everyone with his gravity-defying display in the floor. His superb routine earned him 15.663 points, giving him victory from Brazilian duo Diego Hypolito and Arthur Mariano and earning Great Britain a maiden individual gold in artistic gymnastics. No one was more taken aback than Whitlock himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn emotional moment \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a massive surprise. I wasn\u2019t expecting it for the floor,\u201d he said in response to his achievement. \u201cIt was my first Olympic floor final, let alone a medal. In actual fact, I was happy to make the floor to ease me into the competition for the pommel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t watching anything. I wasn\u2019t watching the routines in front of me or after me. I didn\u2019t know where I was placed. Scott, my coach, just nudged me on the leg and said, \u2018Max, you\u2019re Olympic champion\u2019. And the emotion just hit me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nMax strikes gold again\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than two hours later, Whitlock was back in action on the pommel. His team-mate Louis Smith, who had won silver in London four years earlier, set the bar for Whitlock by taking the lead with an excellent score of 15.833 points. The next man out, Whitlock bettered it with a fluid routine full of finesse, one that earned him 15.966 points and with it a second gold of the afternoon and a third medal of the Games, with Smith picking up another silver behind him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's just an incredible feeling,\u201d said Whitlock after becoming Great Britain\u2019s first double Olympic artistic gymnastics champion. \u201cAll the gymnasts out there know how much work goes into it. You get one minute to show what you've been working on for the last however many years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA champion in the making \r\n\r\n\r\nWhitlock took up gymnastics when he was seven. Showing rich early promise, he developed his skills on every apparatus, excelling in the pommel horse in particular. He won the European junior title in the event in Birmingham in 2010, while also winning silver in the individual all-around. That same year he made his senior debut, aged 17, at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, pocketing silvers in the team all-around and pommel horse and bronze in the horizontal bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitlock and his team-mates than scored a major success in taking the European team all-around title in Montpellier (FRA) in 2012, the perfect preparation for the London Games, where he broke new ground for British gymnastics with his two bronzes. More glory was to come his way at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, in the shape of five medals, three of them gold (team all-around, individual all-around and floor), making him the most decorated British gymnast of the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain\u2019s first world championAn untimely bout of glandular fever upset Whitlock\u2019s preparations for Rio 2016. Sidelined for six months, he made the best possible reappearance at the 2015 Worlds in Glasgow, producing a superb performance on the pommel horse to amass 16.133 points and become his country\u2019s first artistic gymnastics world champion in the 112-year history of the event. Team and floor silver also came his way in the Scottish city, a sign that he was more than ready to write his name into British sporting history in Rio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He also won the AAU high jump and pole vault that year. The American team for the Paris Olympics stopped off for the British AAA Championships and Baxter took the high jump at 6-2 (1.88). At the Paris Games he jumped marginally higher and won the Olympic gold medal at 6-2\u00bd (1.89). Later the same day, he won the pole vault in somewhat bizarre circumstances. Daniel Horton and Bascom Johnson, who had both beaten Baxter at the British meet, were missing, as was Charles Dvorak, who would become Olympic champion in 1904. Johnson and Dvorak had left the grounds on being told that the pole vault had been postponed, and Horton declined to compete on sabbatical grounds. Notwithstanding the information given to Johnson and Dvorak, the event was held as scheduled and Baxter, who was still at the field after his high jump victory, registered as a last-minute entry and won his second Olympic title. The following day he finished second to Ray Ewry in all three standing jumps, thus winning a total of five Olympic medals in the space of two days. In 1901, Baxter returned to England where he successfully defended his British high jump title but, as at the Olympics, he was involved in drama surrounding the pole vault. Baxter had arrived at the Championships without a pole and as the only other competitor refused to lend him his, Baxter uprooted a flagpole, cleared the same height as his rival, and shared the British championship. Baxter was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1901 and in 1903 he was chosen as a special city judge on the Democratic ticket. Apart from a break during World War I, he continued in private law practice until 1921, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Northern District of New York. In 1925 he resigned and returned to private practice. \r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Bests: HJ \u2013 6-3\u00bd (1.918) (1900); PV \u2013 3.35 (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Popov took up swimming at the age of eight and, at that time, he was afraid of water, but his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons. Popov started out as a backstroke swimmer and switched to freestyle only in 1990. A year later, Popov competed at his first international tournament, the 1991 European Championships, and established himself as the world\u2019s top freestyle sprinter by winning the 100 freestyle and helping the Soviet team win both the 4x100 freestyle relay and medley relay titles. Nearly unbeatable in the 1990s, Popov won gold medals in the 50 and 100 sprint events at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics and added silver in both the 4x100 freestyle relay and medley relay at those Olympics. His comeback to world-class swimming after the Atlanta Olympics was the stuff of legend. During an altercation on a Moscow street with an Azeri watermelon vendor, he was stabbed in the abdomen, with the knife grazing his lung and an artery to his kidney. He required emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. Popov competed at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, but was touched out in the 100 by Pieter van den Hoogenband, winning a silver medal. Popov also competed in 2004, without winning a medal, and retired shortly after the Athens Olympic Games, where he was the Russian flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the World Championships Popov won the 50 free in 1994 and 2003, and the 100 free in 1994, 1998, and 2003. His World Championship record saw him win gold six times, silver four times, and bronze once between 1994 and 2003. At the European Championships, after his three 1991 titles, Popov went on to win 21 gold and 26 totals medals, competing at that meet through 2004, and ending with gold in the 2004 50 metre freestyle. During his career Popov set one world record at both of the two sprint distances: 48.21 in the 100 free in 1994, which stood for six years, and 21.64 in the 50 free in 2000, which stood for eight years. Popov was elected as the European Swimmer of the Year in 1994 and 2003 and the Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopov was elected as a full member of the IOC in December 1999. He also represented the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes\u2019 Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes\u2019 Commission at the 2000 Olympics and is now the IOC Athletes\u2019 Commission\u2019s Honorary Secretary. Popov has been named to the IOC Evaluation Commission for the 2016 Olympics. Popov is an advisor to the Russian president in sports matters and a member of the Executive Committee of the Russian National Olympic Committee. Since 2004, Popov has been vice-president of the Russian Swimming Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Best: 50 m freestyle \u2013 21.64 (2000); 100 m freestyle \u2013 48.21 (1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At the European Championships she earned six gold, four silver and two bronze medals between 1989 and 1997, amongst them two golds in the 400 free in 1993 and 1997. She also took part in three Long-Course Worlds in 1991, 1994 and 1998, winning two golds, three silvers and one bronze medal, with 200 backstroke silvers in 1991 and 1998. Hase won seven Olympic medals, crowned by her 1992 gold in the 400 freestyle, winning three medals in 1992 and four in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the World Championships in 1994 she qualified for the 200 metres freestyle as the eight best swimmer but her teammate Franziska van Almsick swam only the ninth best qualification time. Therefore Hase abandoned her start place and offered it to van Almsick, who then won the gold medal in the final bettering the world record. At the same competition Hase herself swam only the ninth best qualification time over 400 metres freestyle, but her teammate Jana Henke (later sixth in the final) did not abandon her starting place, although Hase would have had the better chances.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the 1991 German reunification Hase came under doping suspicion by Brigitte Berendonk and the documents of the Military Medical Academy in Bad Saarow, which was also confirmed in the GDR doping investigation between 1998 and 2000. It was later announced that Hase, along with Kristin Otto, Heike Friedrich and Daniela Hunger, had taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) at the 1989 European Championships at Bonn. The testosterone levels of these female swimmers corresponded to normal male values, but Hase always denied taking PEDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But it was in Istanbul, at the 1999 European Championships, that he truly announced his arrival on the international scene, winning a total of six gold medals in the 50m freestyle and butterfly, the 100m and 200m butterfly, the 100m and 200m freestyle, and the 4x100m freestyle and medley relays.\r\n\r\n\r\nTorpedoing Thorpe in Sydney\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australian fans at the International Aquatic Centre in Homebush Bay rose to cheer the feats of the host nation's swimming team on a daily basis; but \u201cVDH\u201d was intent on gatecrashing the party. He had particularly high hopes in the 200m freestyle, laying down a marker in the semi-final by beating Ian Thorpe\u2019s world record with a time of 1:45.35, and then producing a replica performance in the final to beat the local favourite to the finish and claim gold. Two days later, on 19 September 2000, he set another world record (47.84) in the 100m freestyle semi-final, and in so doing became the first swimmer to break the 48-second barrier. In the final, even the mighty Russian, Alexander Popov, was powerless to prevent van den Hoogenband from capturing a second gold, as the Dutchman became only the third swimmer \u2013 after Michael Wenden (AUS) in 1968 and Mark Spitz (USA) in 1972 \u2013 to win the 100m and 200m freestyle at the same Games.\r\n\r\n\r\nPipping Phelps in Athens\r\n\r\n\r\nCuriously, van den Hoogenband never won a world championship gold, instead collecting eight silvers and two bronze medals in the 50m, 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay between 1998 and 2007. He did though set a 100m world record that remained unbeaten for eight years. He also remains the only swimmer to twice finish ahead of Michael Phelps in Olympic competition, both times at Athens 2004: he claimed second place in the 200m, relegating the all-conquering American to third, and produced an astonishing anchor leg of 46.79 to help the Netherlands take silver in the 4x100m relay, ahead of the USA. On 18 August, he sealed his place in swimming history by successfully defending his Olympic 100m title, recording a time of 48.17 to overcome South Africa\u2019s Roland Schoeman and his old rival Ian Thorpe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal fling in Beijing\r\n\r\n\r\nVan den Hoogenband was back in the Olympic pool at Beijing 2008, reaching the final of the 100m to become the first swimmer to do so at four successive editions of the Games. After finishing fifth, the Dutchman announced his decision to retire from the pool, having firmly established himself in the pantheon of swimming greats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Three of these were in freestyle and two in Greco-Roman. His only World Championship title came in 1961 when he won the unlimited freestyle championship. In 1967 he also won that division in the European championships. Dietrich was unbeaten in the unlimited freestyle from 1955 to 1962. At the World Championships he also won two silver and two bronze medals between 1957 and 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\nDietrich was the best ever wrestler from Germany as well as one of the best in the world in both styles after World War II. In 1972 at M\u00fcnchen, he won a legendary victory against the 187 kg US-wrestler Chris Taylor with the later so-called \"Jahrhundertwurf\" (Century Grip). In West Germany he won 30 national titles during his career. He later immigrated to South Africa, because he could not find any employment in West Germany. He returned several times because the language barrier was a problem for him. Before his final return to Germany, he died from a heart attack in 1992 in Durbanville. In 2008 he was inducted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports and in 2014 inducted to the International Wrestling Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He is also the only person to win medals at five consecutive Games, and in 2012 became only the second man to win four golds after Denmark\u2019s Paul Elvstr\u00f8m. After winning a silver medal in the 1996 Laser class, Ainslie won three consecutive titles in one-person dinghy, from 2000 to 2008, and in the one-person heavyweight dinghy in 2012. Ainslie had the honour of being the first torch bearer as the Olympic flame made its 8,000-mile trip around Britain in advance of the 2012 Games, and at the opening ceremony he was Great Britain\u2019s flag bearer. In addition to his Olympic medal collection, he has won six world titles in the Finn (2002-05, 2008, 2012), in the Laser (1999), and one in the Laser Radial (1993). In European Championships he won nine titles: four in Finn, four in Laser, one in Laser Radial class and one in match racing. Ainslie was rated ISAF sailor of the year three times, and was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2008, following his third Olympic title. \r\n\r\n\r\nDespite all his world and Olympic titles, it is in the 2013 America\u2019s Cup that Ainslie is remembered for his part in leading Oracle to a remarkable comeback from 8-1 down in the best-of-17 series to capture a memorable win for Team USA. Only a few months before this amazing comeback, Ainslie was knighted in what he described as the proudest moment of his life. He retired from Olympic competition after 2012 and concentrated on the America\u2019s Cup. In June 2014 he set up Ben Aislie Racing (BAR) with the sole aim of winning the famous trophy for Great Britain for the first time. BAR won the World Series of qualifiers but subsequently failed to make it through to Challenge for the 2017 America\u2019s Cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She emulated this performance in Athens, winning the 200 m gold after a very good last lane by just 0.23 over Leisel Jones. After these victories, Beard started modelling, appearing in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition and Playboy, among others. Beard's 2008 Olympic performance was marked by her anti-fur protest, posing nude in a campaign for animal rights organisation PETA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "bio":"\r\n\r\n\r\nNever better than when Olympic medals are at stake, Great Britain\u2019s Jason Kenny enjoyed a Rio 2016 to remember. As well as retaining his individual and team sprint titles, he added the keirin for good measure to take his collection of golds to six, the same number as compatriot and fellow cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, and more than any other British athlete in the history of the Games.\r\n\r\n\r\nA golden start\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in Bolton, north west England, Jason Kenny took up track cycling at the age of 15, and won European and world junior individual and team sprint and keirin titles in 2006. Two years later, a 20-year-old Kenny took on fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy in the Olympic individual sprint final at Beijing 2008. Beaten in the first two races by the Scot, he had to settle for silver. It was Kenny\u2019s second medal of his maiden Games, the first having come three days earlier, when he linked up with Hoy and Jamie Staff to beat reigning three-time world champions France in the team sprint final. The British trio\u2019s time of 42.950 was a new world record. In winning gold and silver at the first attempt, the young Bolton flyer had set a standard he would more than match in Games to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed king\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the years between Beijing 2008 and London 2012, Kenny was invariably upstaged by France\u2019s Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 at the UCI World Championships. The only exception came in 2011 in Appeldorn (NED), where the Frenchman was disqualified after winning the first two races in the final, handing Kenny the title. Baug\u00e9 was back on top in April 2012 in Melbourne (AUS), just a few months before the London Olympics, collecting another world gold at the Englishman\u2019s expense. When their home Games eventually came around, Kenny and his British team-mates Hoy and Philip Hindes got off to the best of starts in the team sprint, posting an Olympic record of 43.065 in qualification. They followed up with a new world record of 42.747 in their first-round race against Japan, before going even faster to beat the French trio of Baug\u00e9, Michael d\u2019Almeida and K\u00e9vin Sireau to the gold, Kenny and his colleagues posting another world-record time of 42.600. \r\n\r\n\r\nKenny was in majestic form in the individual sprint four days later, picking off his opponents one by one before seeing off old rival Baug\u00e9 in two races in the final to clinch his third Olympic gold and send the home crowd wild. \u201cI didn\u2019t ride a great race in the final, if I\u2019m honest. I just let the crowd carry me over the line,\u201d said the new Olympic champion, who was selected for the event ahead of Hoy and was only too happy to deliver the gold he was certain his team-mate would also have won. \r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing for Rio\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following year, Kenny scored what he regards as one of the finest and most unexpected wins of his whole career, landing the world keirin title in Minsk (BLR). Having performed below his best in the world championships leading up to London 2012, not unlike the rest of the all-conquering British team, Kenny held nothing back in the 2016 Track Cycling World Championships, held in the British capital in March, where the three-time Olympic champion revealed his hunger for more success by winning individual sprint gold. \u201cJason sees the Olympics as the end goal and he has a plan to get there,\u201d said former team-mate Hoy. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t want to win. He doesn\u2019t go to the worlds or a World Cup thinking: 'I cannot be bothered\u2019. He still wants to do it. There is obviously something that doesn\u2019t quite engage mentally or physically until it really counts. It\u2019s quite a nice thing to have in many ways because his rivals will be terrified. They won\u2019t know what is happening with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe golden couple \r\n\r\n\r\nKenny proved Hoy right at Rio 2016, where he enjoyed a stunning Games. After winning his third straight team pursuit gold, this time in the company of Hindes and the hugely promising Callum Skinner and at the expense of Australia in the final, he retained his individual title by outpacing Skinner in the gold medal match\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeople keep saying I have won five, but I don\u2019t feel any different from the other day when I only had three,\u201d said Kenny, who did not stop there.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of this world\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, Kenny did just as Hoy had done at Beijing 2008 and took the keirin title, the Englishman crossing the line 0.04 seconds ahead of Matthijs Buchli of the Netherlands. In doing so, he matched the Scot\u2019s tally of six Olympic golds, a British record. \u201cI was in Beijing when Chris rocketed to stardom,\u201d said Kenny. \u201cTo be doing the same thing eight years later is amazing. It\u2019s an incredible feeling.\u201d Giving his view of the Bolton rider\u2019s achievement, Hoy said: \u201cJason was untouchable in Rio. He was on a different planet. He coped with a huge amount of pressure and he\u2019s a true champion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    To cap a momentous few weeks in his life, that September Kenny married his fianc\u00e9e and team-mate Laura Trott, a double gold medallist in the team pursuit and omnium at both London 2012 and Rio 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Janz\u2019s specialty was the uneven bars apparatus, in which she won a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics, gold in 1972, and the 1970 world title.

But Janz also excelled on other apparatuses, winning four titles at the 1969 European Championships, and the horse vault at the 1972 Olympics. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter concluding her athletic career, Janz completed medical school, and worked as an orthopedic surgeon. She was the designer of the Charit\u00e9 intervertebral disk, the best known artificial disk replacement in spine surgery. She was named Sportswoman of the Year in 1967 and 1972. In 2000 she was elected Female Gymnast of the Century, and in 2003 she was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame, and in 2011 into the German Sports Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Still just 24, Biles is already in an extremely exclusive \u2018legendary\u2019 category of Olympians, occupied by the likes of the Jamaican sprinter and American swimmer. She is already the greatest gymnast that ever lived. But she\u2019s also doing it her own way.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiles rose to fame in 2013 \u2013 winning two World Championship golds aged just 16, including the all-around title. She followed that with four Worlds golds in 2014 and another four in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time Rio 2016 \u2013 her first Olympics \u2013 rolled around, she was already a superstar and the hottest of hot favourites for the title. She didn\u2019t disappoint: Biles won gold in the all-around, team, vault and floor, and bronze on the beam.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer dominance is built on an utter mastery of gymnastic basics: with a tiny 4 foot 8 frame, incredible athletic ability and power, plus a low centre of gravity, she is built to be the ultimate gymnast. Add in supreme levels of hard work, a great imagination when it comes to her craft, and megawatt levels of personality, and she is almost unbeatable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat imagination was on show at the 2019 World Championships in Stuttgart - at which she won five golds including the all-around title - when she came up with two different new skills which will be named after her in the women\u2019s code of points. Biles wowed fans and judges with a triple twisting double tuck on the floor, and a double twisting double tuck dismount off the balance beam, which had previously only existed in gymnastics fans\u2019 imaginations before Biles made them reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tokyo 2020, in 2021, Biles won a further two medals to take her already impressive Olympic collection to a grand total of seven.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American was part of the women's team that clinched silver, before withdrawing from the individual all-around competition, the vault final, and uneven bars final citing mental health concerns. Biles returned to claim bronze on the balance beam for a second consecutive Games, and has become a mental health advocate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In 2002 at the Pan-Pacifics, she was more dominant, winning six medals, four gold, with three individual championships in the 100 free, 100 fly, and 100 back. Coughlin was an early favorite for the 2004 Olympics, but her performance in 2003, and especially at the World Championships, was lackluster. There she won only two relay medals, although it was later revealed that she was quite sick and had considered not competing. Although somewhat overshadowed by the media attention given Michael Phelps, Coughlin was the top female swimmer at the 2004 Olympic Games, winning five medals, including two gold. Individually, she won the 100 metre backstroke and finished third in the 100 freestyle. She won her second gold medal in the 800 metre freestyle relay, and added two silvers as a member of the United States\u2019 teams in the other relays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoughlin continued after 2004 and won a 4x200 freestyle relay gold medal at the 2005 World Championships. In 2007, she won the 100 backstroke and 200 freestyle at the Worlds, adding a gold medal in the 4x2 free relay. In Beijing, she was again eclipsed by the frenzy that surrounded American swimmers Michael Phelps and Dara Torres. But she competed in six events, winning a medal in all of them, highlighted by an individual gold medal in the 100 backstroke, becoming the first woman to defend that Olympic title.

Her interest in cycling was stirred at the age of 11, when she and her elder sister Kerrie watched Kathy Watt, Australia\u2019s 1992 Olympic road race champion, compete at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. \u201cWe were most interested in track cycling and in the speed of the velodrome,\u201d she explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir father promptly found them a club. The only snag was that it was located 300km away, in Mackay. \u201cHe drove us in one weekend; we fell in love with the sport,\u201d recalled Meares. \u201cSo for two years, mum and dad would pick Kerrie and me up from school on a Friday afternoon, drive the 300km for us to race Friday night and Sunday morning, before driving home in time for school on Monday morning.\u201d The family then made the decision to move to the town of Rockhampton, which had its own velodrome, giving Anna and Kerrie the opportunity to practice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nA world record in Athens \r\n\r\n\r\nA 500m world junior champion in 2001, the up-and-coming Anna then won individual sprint bronze at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester (GBR), where Kerrie took gold in the 500m time trial. At the age of 19, Meares joined the Australian Institute of Sport in Adelaide, continuing her studies while enjoying great success in the international arena. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter winning 500m time trial gold at the worlds in Melbourne in 2004, she went on to claim Olympic glory in Athens in the same event, posting a new world record of 33.952 and becoming the first female rider to dip under the 34-second mark. Having qualified with the fastest time in the sprint event, she made up for the disappointment of losing to Canada\u2019s Lori-Ann Muenzer in the semi-final by beating Russia\u2019s Svetlana Grankovskaya in the bronze medal race.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore medals\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the Australian claimed a second 500m world title in Palma (ESP). When her favourite event was removed from the Olympic programme, Meares chose to take part in the sprint at Beijing 2008, reaching the final, where she lost 2-0 to her British rival Victoria Pendleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeares went on to win gold medals in every track cycling speed event (500m time trial, keirin, sprint and team sprint) at the three world championships held between 2009 and 2011, a feat unprecedented in the sport.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon glory \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Australian faced Pendleton once more in the London 2012 sprint final. The British rider, who was keen to cap her career with a gold medal on home soil, was disqualified in the first race, with \u00a0the resilient Meares then winning the second in front of a vociferous crowd to claim the Olympic title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cRacing in front of that crowd was something unique,\u201d she said after the final. \u201cThe decibel measure that was taken was about 114 and 95 per cent of that was aimed towards Victoria. I was very nervous and I'm glad I dyed my hair before the competition because otherwise I would have gone grey!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA record in 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nMeares\u2019 long-held dream of surpassing F\u00e9licia Ballanger\u2019s World Championship gold medal total of 10 finally became reality in February 2015, when the 31-year-old Australian made it world title number 11 in the keirin in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (FRA). Her next goal was to add to her collection of Olympic medals at Rio 2016.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nCarrying the flag\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Opening Ceremony in Rio saw Meares become only the second cyclist to have the honour of carrying Australia\u2019s flag, after Dunc Gray at Berlin 1936. Entering three events in total, the two-time Olympic champion made her first bid for a medal in the team sprint, where she and team-mate Stephanie Morton were just beaten to the bronze by Germany\u2019s Kristina Vogel and Miriam Welte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSix medals in four Games\r\n\r\n\r\nMeares had higher hopes of success in the keirin the following day. Fifth in the event at London 2012, she went two better on this occasion, finishing a tyre-width behind Great Britain\u2019s Rebecca James, with the gold going to Elis Ligtlee of the Netherlands. \u201cUnfortunately I stepped into the bend three wide coming into the finish line and that cost me a little bit of speed,\u201d said the Australian speedster afterwards. \u201cBut at the same time I had to go, so I'm really pleased. This was the main motivating force to keep riding from London, to better my result from this event.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\nThat bronze, her sixth Olympic medal, made her Australia\u2019s most decorated cycling Olympian and the first athlete from the country to win individual medals at four consecutive Games. \u201cAll my goals were for this event [the keirin], so tomorrow I'm just going to go out there and have fun,\u201d she said ahead of her sprint title defence, which would end in the second round, with Meares eventually taking tenth place in the competition. \r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Two months later, on 16 October 2016, the greatest Australian cyclist of them all announced her retirement from the sport at the age of 33, stating: \u201cI didn't get a fairy tale ending [to these Olympics] but I had a good ending.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He d\u00e9buted at the Olympics with a silver in the horse vault. His greatest successes came at the World Championships, winning the floor exercise title in both 1954 and 1958. He missed a medal in the 1956 floor event due to a poor compulsory exercise, but made up for it by winning three individual bronzes and a silver with the Japanese team. In 1960, when Takemoto was already 41, he added a third Olympic silver medal (on the bar) and crowned his career with an Olympic gold in the team all-around. Having completed his education at Nippon Sport Science University, he went on to become the coach of the Japanese men's gymnastics team. In 1997, he was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At the 1988 Seoul Olympics she earned bronze medals in the 100 and 200 m, and silver in the long jump, later winning long jump gold medals in 1992 and 2000. Her list of championships is long, including gold medals in the long jump at the 1983 and 1993 World Championships, four consecutive titles at the European Championships (1986-98), the 1987 Indoor World Championships, four Indoor European Championships \u2013 1986-88 and 1994, the 1992 Grand-Prix Title, World Cup Champion in 1985, 1992 and 1998, six-time European Cup champion and nine-time German Champion. Drechsler set five outdoor world records, two in the 200, and three in the long jump, and eight indoor world records, one in the 200 and seven in the long jump. During her career Drechsler earned numerous awards\\: 1986 East German Sportswoman of the Year, 1998 and 2000 German Sportswoman of the Year, Female Long Jumper of the Century by the magazine Track & Field News, the Distinguished Career Award by the IAAF in 2000, Rudolf-Harbig-Ged\u00e4chtnispreis in 1999, and the German TV award BAMBI in 1998 and 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrechsler studied pedagogy and later made her living as a sports manager. Until the reunification of Germany she was a member of the SED Central Party and a member of Parliament. Between 1986-88 the East German Stasi (Staatssicherheit) listed her on their records, but she always denied any activities for them. In 1984 she married Andreas Drechsler, whose father Erich was her long-time coach, even after their 1997 divorce. From 1995 to 2007 she was the partner of former French decathlete Alain Blondel.

In 1982, he won his first World Cup events. Two years later, at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, his moment had arrived: Ning Li won six medals, three of them gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nA team bronze\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the Chinese gymnastics team excelled, but in the team event it lost the Olympic title by 0.6 points to the USA. Ning\u2019s first Olympic medal was a silver one, and this heralded the start of an impressive harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the all-around competition, Ning made a mistake on the parallel bars, which penalised him for the final ranking. With 118.575 points, the Chinese gymnast finished third behind America\u2019s Peter Vidmar, silver medallist, and Japan\u2019s Koji Gushiken, who won the gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made up for this in the floor exercises, winning his first gold medal with the excellent score of 19.925 out of 20. He beat his compatriot Lou Yun, who managed 19.775.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo gold medallists, twice\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the pommel horse, the competition was even tougher. Ning Li produced a remarkable performance which earned him the score of 19.950. The American Peter Vidmar also achieved an excellent performance. The two athletes had identical scores, and both stood on the top step of the podium. On the rings, Ning Li this time had to share the honours with Japan\u2019s Koji Gushiken, as both men finished with the score of 19.850.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vault, for the first time in this event, four gymnasts tied for second place. With a score of 19.825, Li won silver, his sixth medal, making him the athlete with the most medals at the 1984 edition of the Games. This achievement earned him the nickname of \u201clittle prince of gymnastics\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess beyond the Games\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years later, at the Games in Seoul, Ning Li could not repeat his achievements, lacking that extra element that had made him successful previously.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his sports career, Ning Li founded his own sports equipment company. He married his compatriot Youg-Yan Chen, a gymnast like himself and a bronze medallist at the 1984 Games. The little prince has today made a success of his post-competition career.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 8 August 2008, the organisers of the Beijing Olympic Games gave him the great honour of selecting him as the last Olympic torchbearer \u2013 the person with the enormous responsibility of lighting the Olympic cauldron. Everyone will always remember the image of Ning Li \u201cflying\u201d around the perimeter of the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At the age of 16 he appeared at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where he won his first medal, a silver, over the same distance, an achievement that he celebrated by having the Olympic rings tattooed on his right hip. A year later, he claimed the first of a slew of world and Olympic titles, winning gold in the 200m backstroke at the 2001 World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka (JPN), breaking the world record for the first of seven times in the process. It was the start of a long success story.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold rush\r\n\r\n\r\nPeirsol was one of the stars of the USA swim team at Athens 2004, scoring a 100m\/200m backstroke double and picking up another gold medal in the men\u2019s 4x100m medley. Four years later in Beijing he retained his 100m backstroke title and won gold again in the men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay, though he was second best to compatriot Ryan Lochte in the 200m backstroke. His overall medal haul from his three appearances in the Games was five golds and two silvers. The backstroke specialist collected a host of medals at each of the five world championships he competed in between 2001 and 2009, winning the world title in the 200m backstroke, 100m backstroke and 4x100m medley relay on four separate occasions. During his illustrious career, which also saw him compete in several editions of the Pan-American and Pan-Pacific Games, he amassed a total of 36 medals at major competitions, 29 of them gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hatful of records\r\n\r\n\r\nPeirsol broke the 100m backstroke world record six times in all, most recently on 8 July 2008, when he swam 51.94 in the American trials for Beijing 2008 in Indianapolis. He also set seven world records in his preferred event, the 200m, leaving his mark at 1.51.92 in winning the final at the 2009 World Swimming Championships in Rome. Two days later he helped set the last of five world 4x100m medley records, winning another gold in the Italian capital with a time of 3.27.29. All three of those records stand to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n28 and out\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnouncing his competitive retirement in early 2011, Peirsol said: \u201cI ended up doing everything I set out to do.\u201d A University of Texas graduate, majoring in government, he is now devoting his energies to protecting the oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Two days later, Thorpe earned a silver medal behind Pieter van den Hoogenband in the 200m freestyle. Next he swam the leadoff leg for Australia's 4x200m freestyle relay team that went on to win in world record time.

Even when she decided that judo was for her, Tamura had to overcome her mother\u2019s resistance. \u201cShe would have preferred me to play the piano or to have had tennis lessons, something more fitting for a young girl,\u201d she explains.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly inspiration\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding only 1.46m tall, Tamura went on to make her name in the 48kg category, the lightest of all, eventually becoming the undisputed world No1 at that weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her early years, she took inspiration from Great Britain\u2019s pioneering four-time world champion Karen Briggs. She competed against her role model for the first time as a 15-year-old at the Fukuoka Cup in 1990, the first international women\u2019s judo competition to be held in Japan. The teenager beat her idol on that occasion, her first major victory, though Briggs had her revenge in the World Championship semi-finals a year later, with the Japanese youngster having to make do with bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympic debut\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen\u2019s judo made its official Olympic debut at Barcelona 1992, where Tamura, still only 16, reached the final before going down to France\u2019s Cecile Nowak. She achieved star status in Japan in winning her first world title the following year in Hamilton (CAN), a feat she repeated on home soil in Chiba (JPN) in 1995. She went to Atlanta 1996 as the firmest of favourites, having won 84 contests in a row, but had to settle for the silver once more after losing to the teenage Kye Sunhui of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvincible aura\r\n\r\n\r\nShe responded to that defeat by going a whole 12 years unbeaten at international level. In the process, she maintained her dominance of the world championships, recording five more consecutive triumphs between 1997 and 2007 to take her haul of titles to seven, which was then an outright record for both men and women. Tamura\u2019s first Olympic gold medal finally came at Sydney 2000, where she needed only 36 seconds to beat Russia\u2019s Lyubov Bruletova by ippon in the final.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at those Games that she met her future husband, Japanese baseball player Yoshimoto Tani. Competing as Ryoko Tamura-Tani at Athens 2004, she reached her fourth consecutive Olympic final, defeating France\u2019s Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Jossinet by waza-ari to become the first female judoka to retain her title.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn idol to millions\r\n\r\n\r\nTamura-Tani\u2019s sustained success earned her a large and devoted following in Japan and saw her become the main character in a popular Japanese comic book, while her appearances at major competitions attracted a huge amount of media interest. She gave birth to her first child in 2005 and three years later she was back on the Olympic stage in Beijing, where she won bronze after\u00a0losing out to Romania\u2019s Alina Dumitru in the semi-finals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot content with winning five medals in as many Games, a tearful Tamura-Tani said she would be back at London 2012. After having her second child, however, she announced her retirement in 2010 and moved into politics, winning a seat in the Japanese parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
